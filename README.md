# An Overview of The Project

The basic CSS template was already produced prior in the first project. This time around, implementing the web page in a component based way using the tools that React and its supporting libraries was the main challenge for this project. 

A design template was given for the desktop version of the "Contact" page, however for VG, we were given the challenge to produce the mobile and tablet versions ourselves. 
The design I settled on seemed like the most simple one, the page itself didn't have any particular content that was worth trimming. 

We were also given the challenge of producing a mobile/tablet menu, which was present before as well in the first project. To that end, I really just adapted much of my code to be able to make use of the React hooks where possbile. Where I saw the opportunity to do so, I improved upon the base design that existed before however.
